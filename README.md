# Atlas_lab_HR_Analytics
This project involves using Power BI to create interactive dashboards that monitor key HR metrics for Atlas Labs, including employee performance, diversity, and attrition rates. The analysis is based on real-world HR data, aimed at providing actionable insights for improving HR practices.

**Key Features:**

**Overview Dashboard:**
Analyzed total number of employees, active vs. inactive counts, hiring trends over the years, and active employees by department and job role.
Overcame challenges with complex dataset structures using custom DAX measures.

**Demographics Dashboard:**
Explored age distribution among employees, revealing that most fall within the 20-29 age group.
Analyzed salary data, highlighting that the average salary for white employees is higher than that of other ethnic groups.

**Performance Tracker Dashboard:**
Evaluated employee satisfaction levels across various metrics (job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, work-life balance, relationships) using self and manager ratings.

**Attrition Dashboard:**
Investigated employee attrition rates by various factors, including:
% Attrition Rate by Department
% Attrition Rate by Hire Date

**Key Findings:**
High attrition rates observed in Sales and HR departments.
Frequent travelers have a higher likelihood of leaving.
High overtime requirements are associated with increased attrition rates.
Longer tenure correlates with lower attrition rates.

**Impact:**
This project significantly improved my Power BI skills and demonstrated how data-driven insights can inform and enhance HR strategies.
